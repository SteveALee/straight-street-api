<a href='http://straight-street.com'>Straight-street.com</a> provides symbols for users of AAC or with other accessibility communications requirements. A key feature is that the symbols are peer reviewed by SLTs and are on the liberal <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/'>CC BY-SA licence</a> which allows copying and derivation. This makes the symbols ideal for use in web applications and the  API enables developers to create innovative software solutions and mashups that use the master symbol set managed by straight-street.com.

This project is a simple PHP/MySQL REST web API used to provide access to the symbols. It uses the DooPHP framework as a lightweight scaffolding - mainly to provide URI to method routing.

The live API instance provides a <a href='http://straight-street.com/api'>usage page</a> with details on using the API and an <a href='http://straight-street.com/api/test.html'>example client web app</a>.

The first app to use the API is <a href='http://code.google.com/p/picboard/'>Picboard</a>
